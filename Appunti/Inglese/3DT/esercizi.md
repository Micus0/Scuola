## Es 9 pag 59

Hi Noah,

I'll be doing a grigliata with my friends, and also other things. But we have five days on holidays for doing something. I don't like exhibitions, perhaps we can do something else, like go out in the park, or in the center, or a bike trip. I prefer going skiing in the mountains, but in the holidays, there won't be snow for skiing.

Do you like this ideas, or do you have other options?

Look forward to hearing from you soon!
