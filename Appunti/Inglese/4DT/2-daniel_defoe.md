Nature in the romance it's dominated.

The ideology of the augustian age was caracterized by reasoning plus dedaction equal problem solving. Robison's actions aren't driven by istinct, but are the result of a logical process. It starts by observing the situation, then he makes a list of all possible solutions, he considers the pros/cons and then he chooses the best alternative (he's the product of the englightement).
